# SWAPI-Starship-Sorter
This repository contains a python function that lists the starships in Star Wars and their crew sizes from smallest to largest.

The content of the list is from https://swapi.dev/  - the Star Wars API with the “/starships/” endpoint. The API is paginated and you should be getting 36 results in total.

The expected output is in the form of [["Naboo star skiff", 3], ["Millennium Falcon", 4], ...]

This function was created as part of my hiring process when I applied as a Tech VA. I was instructed to host the script on replit.com.
